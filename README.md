## Introduction
Repository for master thesis at KTH Royal Institute of Technology during the 
spring 2021, 
in collaboration with Hedvig. The objective has been to analyze data on clicks
using Google Analytics, in order to find insights on how to optimize digital 
marketing spend for growth of customer base and/or ROI. 
Two reports have been written as part of 
- DA233X: Degree Project
in Computer Science and Engineering, specializing in Machine Learning, and
- SF280X: Degree project in Optimization and Systems Theory.

## Content & Instructions
All the code can be found in 'Models/' and the experiments are run from 'Experiments.py'. Exploratory data analysis is 
conducted in 'Descriptives.py'. A few simulator parameters may be adjusted via
'Simulator.py'. 

The reports may be found in 'Reports/', where 
'Master_Thesis_Report_SF280X' is more applied and should preferably 
be read before 'Master_Thesis_Report_DA233X'.
